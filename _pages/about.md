I am an Assistant Professor in the [School of Earth and Space Sciences](https://sess.pku.edu.cn) at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn) in Beijing, China. 

The overarching theme of my research is to understand the evolution of the ocean, climate, and Earth systems and the interactions between them. This inquiry provides insights into climate change and its feedback mechanisms, the maintenance of Earth's habitability and its role in the origin and evolution of life, and the health of marine ecosystems and economies.

My approach is biogeochemical, through the study of the natural and perturbed cycles of chemical elements in the ocean both today and in the past, to trace the climatic, physical, biological, and geological processes within the ocean and at its boundaries, contributing to the knowledge of how these fundamental processes shape the ocean environment and global climate. 

My tools of the trade are trace elements and isotopes (TEIs), which either participate in the biogeochemical cycling of major elements (such as oxygen and carbon), or are remarkably sensitive indicators of ocean and Earth processes. My research combines analytical and modeling methods for quantitative understanding of marine TEI cycles.

My paper describing SedTrace, a tool for generating and runing marine sediment diagenetic models, has been published in [Geoscientific Model Development](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/16/5865/2023/gmd-16-5865-2023.html). The open-source code can be found on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/8187038).

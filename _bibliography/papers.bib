Abstract = {Core 17954 is located in the modern summer upwelling area in western
   South China Sea, its sediments recorded the variations of upwelling
   generated by East Asia Summer Monsoon (EASM) during MIS 3. Based on the
   strict age model of AMS C-14 dating, the paleo-Sea Surface Temperature
   (SST) and Salinity (SSS) are reconstructed by pairing
   Mg/Ca-Paleothermometer and delta O-18 of planktonic foraminifera
   Globigerinoides ruber (white s.s.). Results show that in Core 17954, the
   delta O-18 record of G.ruber has significant millennium fluctuations as
   the delta O-18 records from NGRIP icecore and Hulu Cave stalagmites,
   this indicates that the climate changes of western SCS contains both
   signals from High Latitude of Northern Hemisphere as well as EASM. In
   order to get more information on upwelling changes, previous records of
   thermocline and foraminiferal primary productivity in Core 17954 are
   collected, restudied and compared. Five distinct shallowing periods of
   thermocline (referred to as S1-S5) are identified in this study. In
   S1-S4, SST is lower and productivity is higher, these indicate to an
   enhanced upwelling and strengthened EASM during these periods. And the
   lower SSS, caused by increasing precipitation or fresh water input, also
   prove this standpoint.},

Abstract = {The isotopic composition of neodymium (epsilon(Nd)) extracted from
   sedimentary Fe-Mn oxyhydroxide offers potential for reconstructing
   paleo-circulation, but its application depends on extraction methodology
   and the mechanisms that relate authigenic epsilon(Nd) to bottom water.
   Here we test methods to extract authigenic epsilon(Nd) from Gulf of
   Alaska (GOA) sediments and assess sources of leachate Nd, including
   potential contamination from trace dispersed volcanic ash. We show that
   one dominant phase is extracted via leaching of core-top sediments.
   Major and trace element geochemistry demonstrate that this phase is
   authigenic Fe-Mn oxyhydroxide. Contamination of leachate (authigenic) Nd
   from detrital sources is insignificant (<1\%); our empirical results are
   consistent with established kinetic mineral dissolution rates and
   theory. Contamination of extracted epsilon(Nd) from leaching of volcanic
   ash is below analytical uncertainty. However, the epsilon(Nd) of
   core-top leachates in the GOA is consistently more radiogenic than
   bottom water. We infer that authigenic phases record pore water
   epsilon(Nd), and the relationships of epsilon(Nd) among bottom waters,
   pore waters, authigenic phases and detrital sediments are primarily
   governed by the exposure time of bottom water to sea-floor sediments,
   rate of exchange across the sediment-water interface and the reactivity
   and composition of detrital sediments. We show that this conceptual
   model is applicable on the Pacific basin scale and provide a new
   framework to understand the role of authigenic phases in both modern and
   paleo-applications, including the use of authigenic epsilon(Nd) as a
   paleo-circulation tracer.(C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We have generated an early Pleistocene benthic isotopic record for the
   Ocean Drilling Program Site 807 (2804m) from the western equatorial
   Pacific. Between 2.4 and 1.7Ma, the benthic C-13 of this site and a few
   other deep Pacific sites was consistently higher than the Southern Ocean
   Site MV0502-4JC (4286m), pointing to a reversal relative to the current
   gradient and hence implying a different circulation regime. We
   reconstructed the deepwater mass distribution of this interval by using
   a collection of benthic isotope records from 15 Pacific and 10 Atlantic
   sites and a C-13-O-18 mixing model. A two-end-member mixing regime
   between the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) and the Antarctic Bottom
   Water (AABW), with properties very different from today, was identified.
   The Southern Ocean showed strong signs of stratification and AABW with
   low benthic C-13, but high O-18 values reached out to other basins only
   below similar to 4000m. In contrast, NADW ventilated most of the ocean
   interior, contributing similar to 70\% to the Pacific Deep Water
   volumetrically. Our model results also reveal a strong remineralization
   effect at the bottom sites of the Pacific and the Atlantic, suggesting
   significant accumulation of respired carbon in the bottom water between
   2.4 and 1.7Ma. We propose that such a circulation pattern was initiated
   by the reversal of salinity gradient between AABW and NADW from 3.0 to
   2.4Ma, possibly linked to Antarctic sea ice expansion and reduced
   southward heat transport during the onset of Northern Hemisphere
   Glaciation.},

Abstract = {Neodymium (Nd) isotopes are considered a valuable tracer of modern and
   past ocean circulation. However, the promise of Nd isotope as a water
   mass tracer is hindered because there is not an entirely self-consistent
   model of the marine geochemical cycle of rare earth elements (REEs, of
   which Nd is one). That is, the prevailing mechanisms to describe the
   distributions of elemental and isotopic Nd are not completely
   reconciled. Here, we use published {[}Nd] and Nd isotope data to examine
   the prevailing model assumptions, and further compare these data to
   emergent alternative models that emphasize benthic processes in
   controlling the cycle of marine REEs and Nd isotopes. Our conclusion is
   that changing from a ``top-down{''} driven model for REE cycling to one
   of a ``bottom-up{''} benthic source model can provide consistent
   interpretations of these data for both elemental and isotopic Nd
   distributions. We discuss the implications such a benthic flux model

Abstract = {During the last deglaciation (19,000-9,000 years ago), atmospheric CO2
   increased by about 80 ppm. Understanding the mechanisms responsible for
   this change is a central theme of palaeoclimatology, relevant for
   predicting future CO2 transfers in a warming world. Deglacial CO2 rise
   hypothetically tapped an accumulated deep Pacific carbon reservoir, but
   the processes remain elusive as they are underconstrained by existing
   tracers. Here we report high-resolution authigenic neodymium isotope
   data in North Pacific sediment cores and infer abyssal Pacific
   overturning weaker than today during the Last Glacial Maximum but
   intermittently stronger during steps of deglacial CO2 rise. Radiocarbon
   evidence suggestive of relatively `old' deglacial deep Pacific water is
   reinterpreted here as an increase in preformed C-14 age of subsurface
   waters sourced near Antarctica, consistent with movement of aged carbon
   out of the deep ocean and release of CO2 to the atmosphere during the
   abyssal flushing events. The timing of neodymium isotope changes
   suggests that deglacial acceleration of Pacific abyssal circulation
   tracked Southern Hemisphere warming, sea-ice retreat and increase of
   mean ocean temperature. The inferred magnitude of circulation changes is
   consistent with deep Pacific flushing as a significant, and perhaps
   dominant, control of the deglacial rise of atmospheric CO2.},

Abstract = {The progress of science is tied to the standardization of measurements,
   instruments, and data. This is especially true in the Big Data age,
   where analyzing large data volumes critically hinges on the data being
   standardized. Accordingly, the lack of community-sanctioned data
   standards in paleoclimatology has largely precluded the benefits of Big
   Data advances in the field. Building upon recent efforts to standardize
   the format and terminology of paleoclimate data, this article describes
   the Paleoclimate Community reporTing Standard (PaCTS), a crowdsourced
   reporting standard for such data. PaCTS captures which information
   should be included when reporting paleoclimate data, with the goal of
   maximizing the reuse value of paleoclimate data sets, particularly for
   synthesis work and comparison to climate model simulations. Initiated by
   the LinkedEarth project, the process to elicit a reporting standard
   involved an international workshop in 2016, various forms of digital
   community engagement over the next few years, and grassroots working
   groups. Participants in this process identified important properties
   across paleoclimate archives, in addition to the reporting of
   uncertainties and chronologies; they also identified archive-specific
   properties and distinguished reporting standards for new versus legacy
   data sets. This work shows that at least 135 respondents overwhelmingly
   support a drastic increase in the amount of metadata accompanying
   paleoclimate data sets. Since such goals are at odds with present
   practices, we discuss a transparent path toward implementing or revising
   these recommendations in the near future, using both bottom-up and
   top-down approaches.},

Abstract = {Columbia River megafloods occurred repeatedly during the last

   are largely unknown. To reconstruct changes in ocean circulation during
   this period, we used a numerical model to simulate the flow trajectory
   of Columbia River megafloods and compiled records of sea surface
   temperature, paleo-salinity, and deep-water radiocarbon from marine
   sediment cores in the Northeast Pacific. The North Pacific sea surface
   cooled and freshened during the early deglacial (19.0-16.5 ka) and
   Younger Dryas (12.9-11.7 ka) intervals, coincident with the appearance
   of subsurface water masses depleted in radiocarbon relative to the sea
   surface. We infer that Pacific meltwater fluxes contributed to net
   Northern Hemisphere cooling prior to North Atlantic Heinrich Events, and
   again during the Younger Dryas stadial. Abrupt warming in the Northeast
   Pacific similarly contributed to hemispheric warming during the Bolling
   and Holocene transitions. These findings underscore the importance of

Journal = {Quaternary Science Reviews},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {241},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {The Global Overturning Circulation is linked to climate change on
   glacial-interglacial and multi-millennial timescales. The understanding
   of past climate-circulation links remains hindered by apparent conflicts
   among proxy measures of circulation. Here we reconstruct circulation
   changes since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) based on a global synthesis
   of authigenic neodymium isotope records (epsilon(Nd)). We propose the
   bottom-up framework of interpreting seawater and authigenic epsilon(Nd)
   considering not only conservative watermass mixing, but also the
   preformed properties and the non-conservative behavior of epsilon(Nd),
   both subject to sedimentary influences. We extract the major
   spatial-temporal modes of authigenic epsilon(Nd) using Principal
   Component Analysis, and make a first-order circulation reconstruction
   with budget-constrained box model simulations. We show that during the
   LGM, the source region of North Atlantic overturning shifted southward,
   which led to more radiogenic preformed epsilon(Nd) of glacial Northern
   Source Water (NSW). Considering this preformed effect, we infer that
   glacial deep Atlantic had a similar proportion of NSW as today, although
   the overall strength of glacial circulation appears reduced from both
   North Atlantic and Southern Ocean sources, which increased the relative
   importance of nonconservative behavior of epsilon(Nd) and may have
   facilitated accumulation of respired carbon in the deep ocean. During
   the deglaciation, we find that Southern Ocean overturning increased,
   which offset suppressed North Atlantic overturning and resulted in a net
   stronger global abyssal circulation. Faster global scale deglacial
   circulation reduced the relative importance of non-conservative effects,
   resulting in AtlanticPacific convergence of abyssal epsilon(Nd)
   signatures. Variations of Southern Ocean overturning likely drove a
   significant fraction of deglacial changes in atmospheric CO2 and oceanic
   heat budget. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {Deep-sea ecosystems are highly sensitive to changes in organic matter
   export and oxygenation driven by climate change. Here we document past
   ecological changes in benthic foraminiferal assemblages indicative of
   deglacial changes in deep-sea oxygenation and the character of organic
   matter fluxes from sedimentary records retrieved at intermediate (692 m)
   and abyssal (3667m) depths in the Gulf of Alaska. Constrained
   multivariate ordination combining faunal and geochemical data over the
   past similar to 22,000 years distinguishes the impacts of pulsed
   productivity, which exports carbon to the abyss, from extreme dysoxia
   across the deglacial warming transition. At both depths, opportunistic
   species are more prevalent in interglacial conditions, reflecting higher
   pulsed organic matter export to the seafloor developed in response to
   warming and reduced sea-ice cover. Benthic foraminiferal species
   tolerant of low-oxygen conditions increased in abundance during the
   deglacial transition at both intermediate and abyssal depths. Authigenic
   trace metals reveal sulfidic sedimentary conditions indicative
   intermittent anoxia, but only at intermediate-depths. Benthic
   foraminiferal richness and evenness are also highest during this
   deglacial low-oxygen interval, likely due to high food availability.
   Last Glacial Maximum faunas were distinctly different at the two sites,
   consistent with a more stratified deep Pacific, but the faunas become
   more similar during Holocene time, suggesting destratification of the
   abyss during deglaciation. These ecosystem responses support that carbon
   fluxes increased during warm intervals in subpolar regions and
   underscores the importance of considering the effects of transient
   biological blooms on paleoceanographic interpretations and in model
   projections of future deep carbon export.},

Abstract = {Our understanding of past ocean-climate dynamics is informed by multiple
   paleocirculation proxies including delta C-13, Pa-231/(230Th), and
   radiogenic neodymium isotopes (epsilon(Nd)). Of these, the epsilon(Nd)
   signature of marine authigenic phases is of particular importance as it
   is considered a robust circulation proxy applicable across timescales,
   permitting circulation reconstructions during periods of rapid,
   climatically-induced biological or chemical change (e.g. productivity,
   pH). However, growing evidence of non-conservative behavior and a
   widespread sedimentary source (benthic flux via pore water) of Nd to the
   global ocean suggests that authigenic epsilon(Nd) records do not
   strictly record a water mass signature, highlighting the need to
   reconsider interpretations of the authigenic record. To examine the
   impact of a sedimentary influence on the authigenic record, here we
   compile paired authigenic and detrital neodymium records from every
   major ocean basin and from 80 Ma to present. We then focus on just the
   North Atlantic Ocean basin to examine if this relationship holds up
   regionally and how authigenic epsilon(Nd) changes relate to sediment
   composition changes from two scientific ocean drill cores spanning the
   past 25 ka. We present a new conceptual framework to guide our
   discussion that examines the coupling or decoupling of authigenic and
   detrital epsilon(Nd) in terms of the relative importance of each of the
   three major potential controls as defined in the existing literature
   (bottom water, pore water, sediments) on the authigenic record. Our
   compilation reveals a strong linear relationship between detrital
   epsilon(Nd) and authigenic epsilon(Nd )(correlation coefficient = 0.86,
   n = 871), demonstrating a widespread influence of lithogenically sourced
   neodymium on authigenic epsilon(Nd). We find the same is true within the
   North Atlantic, with the authigenic records at both locations strongly
   influenced by the sediments and likely not recording bottom water

Abstract = {The role of nickel (Ni) in ocean biogeochemical cycles is both
   under-studied and controversial. Strong correlations between Ni and
   organic carbon in modern and ancient marine sediments suggest a
   prominent biogeochemical role over a substantial portion of Earth
   history. Addition of Ni to culturing and seawater incubation experiments
   produces strong responses in terms of cell growth, particularly of
   nitrogen-fixing organisms. But the implied limiting role for
   phytoplankton growth is inconsistent with observations in the real
   ocean, specifically that photic zone Ni concentrations never descend to
   the very low values that characterise other bioactive, and often
   bio-limiting, metals like iron. These two observations can be reconciled
   if a large portion of the total dissolved Ni present in open-ocean
   surface waters is not bio-available on short timescales. Here we present
   new Ni concentration and stable isotope data from the GEOVIDE transect
   in the North Atlantic. We interpret these new data in the light of the
   growing database for Ni stable isotopes in the modern ocean, with
   implications for the biogeochemical importance of Ni.
   In the new North Atlantic dataset, the lowest Ni concentrations (1.8-2.6
   nmol/L) and highest delta Ni-60 (up to +1.67 parts per thousand) are
   associated with low nitrate, south of the subarctic front (SAF). By
   contrast, stations at latitudes north of the SAF, with higher surface
   nitrate, show very subdued variation in Ni concentrations throughout the
   entire depth of the water column (3.6 +/- 0.3 nmol/L, mean and 2SD), and
   no variation in delta Ni-60 beyond the narrow global deep-ocean range
   (+1.33 +/- 0.13 parts per thousand). These North Atlantic Ni isotope
   data also show relationships with nitrogen isotope effects, observed in
   the same samples, that are suggestive of a link between Ni utilisation,
   isotope fractionation and nitrogen fixation.
   The global dataset, including the new data presented here, reveals a
   biogeochemical divide with Ni isotope fractionation only occurring in
   low latitude surface waters. A simple observationally constrained
   three-dimensional model of Ni cycling suggests that the creation of this
   isotopically heavy, Ni-poor, end-member, together with the physical
   circulation and remineralisation at depth, can explain the global
   Ni-delta Ni-60 systematics. Taken together, these findings hint at Ni-N
   co-limitation in the modern ocean. We advocate for more extensive and
   detailed culturing/incubation studies of this neglected metal in order
   to elucidate its potentially crucial biogeochemical role. (C) 2022 The

Abstract = {Rare earth elements (REEs) are powerful tools to track oceanic
   biogeochemical proc-esses. However, our understanding of REE sources is
   incomplete, leading to contro-versial interpretations regarding their
   oceanic cycling. Continental margin sediments are often assumed to be a
   major source, but the sediment pore water data required to understand
   the processes controlling that potential source are scarce. Here, we
   mea-sure and compile pore water and estuarine REE data from the
   Changjiang (Yangtze) estuary-East China Sea shelf. We show that release
   of REEs, from shallow pore water to overlying seawater, is coupled to Mn
   reduction. In contrast, REEs are removed in deep pore water, perhaps via
   formation of an authigenic REE-bearing phase. This sedimentary source
   can potentially explain REE addition in the estuary at mid-high
   salinity. Our calculations suggest that the benthic flux is the largest
   Nd source (similar to 40 \%) on the East China Sea shelf. Globally,
   however, despite a higher benthic Nd flux on the advection-dominated
   shelf, the much more extensive deep ocean still domi-nates the total
   area-integrated benthic flux. Our results call for a more extensive
   investigation of the magnitude of the benthic flux of REEs to the
   oceans.},

Abstract = {Dissolved Rare Earth Elements (REE) and radiogenic neodymium
   (epsilon(Nd)) isotope composition (ENd) of seawater are widely used
   geochemical tools in studying marine processes, but their modern ocean
   budgets are poorly understood. Recent discoveries of large benthic
   fluxes of REE with unique epsilon(Nd) signatures from marine sediments,
   particularly in the deep-sea, have led to a ``bottom-up{''} hypothesis,
   which suggests that early diagenesis below the sediment-water interface
   (SWI) controls the ocean's REE and epsilon(Nd) budgets. To investigate
   such sedimentary processes, we created a reactive-transport model for
   the biogeochemical cycling of Nd and epsilon(Nd) in marine sediments.
   Here, we attempt to quantify the roles of authigenesis, marine silicate
   weathering and reverse weathering in the diagenetic cycling of Nd and
   epsilon(Nd) at a deep-sea (3000 m) site on the Oregon margin.
   Our model predicts that, at this site, Nd carried by Fe/Mn oxides into
   sediments eventually transforms to authigenic Nd-phosphate, during which
   similar to 9\% of the incoming solid Nd flux is released as a dissolved
   benthic flux back to the overlying bottom water. We also find that the
   classic reversible scavenging formulation applied to Nd co-cycling with
   Fe/Mn oxides is inconsistent with the data. Rather, a co-precipitation
   formulation, assuming Nd is structurally incorporated into Fe/Mn oxides,
   successfully simulates the data. The model also shows that authigenesis
   alone cannot explain the pore water and authigenic epsilon(Nd), which
   are both more radiogenic than bottom water at this site. However, the
   weathering of volcanic silicates sourced from the local subduction zone
   can successfully explain epsilon(Nd). We suggest that, because reverse
   weathering by authigenic clay formation maintains the under-saturation
   of primary silicates in pore water, marine silicate weathering can
   proceed. The processes we model likely affect the sedimentary cycling of
   many other trace elements and isotopes, with much broader implications
   for the understanding of ocean biogeochemistry. (C) 2022 The Author(s).

Abstract = {North Pacific deoxygenation events during the last deglaciation were
   sustained over millennia by high export productivity, but the triggering
   mechanisms and their links to deglacial warming remain uncertain(1-3).
   Here we find that initial deoxygenation in the North Pacific immediately
   after the Cordilleran ice sheet (CIS) retreat(4) was associated with
   increased volcanic ash in seafloor sediments. Timing of volcanic inputs
   relative to CIS retreat suggests that regional explosive volcanism was
   initiated by ice unloading(5,6). We posit that iron fertilization by
   volcanic ash(7-9) during CIS retreat fuelled ocean productivity in this
   otherwise iron-limited region, and tipped the marine system towards
   sustained deoxygenation. We also identify older deoxygenation events
   linked to CIS retreat over the past approximately 50,000 years (ref.
   (4)). Our findings suggest that the apparent coupling between the
   atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and solid-Earth systems occurs on
   relatively short timescales and can act as an important driver for ocean
   biogeochemical change.
   Deoxygenation in the North Pacific immediately after the Cordilleran ice

However, its application is complicated by uncertainty in 9Be transfer through the land-ocean interface. The riverine dissolved load alone is insufficient to close the marine 9Be budget, largely due to substantial removal of riverine 9Be to continental margin sediments. We focus on the ultimate fate of this latter Be. We present sediment pore-water Be profiles from diverse continental margin environments to quantify the diagenetic Be release to the ocean. Our results suggest that pore-water Be cycling is mainly controlled by particulate supply and Mn-Fe cycling, leading to higher benthic fluxes on shelves. Benthic fluxes may help close the 9Be budget and are at least comparable to, or higher (~2-fold) than, the riverine dissolved input. These observations demand a revised model framework, which considers the potentially dominant benthic source, to robustly interpret marine Be isotopic records. Benthic fluxes from ocean sediments dominate the oceanic Be budget, complicating the use of 10Be/9Be as a paleo-denudation tracer.},

abstract = {The development of nickel isotopes as a chemical tracer of past ocean environments requires a sound understanding of the modern oceanic budget. Our current understanding of this budget implies a large elemental and isotope imbalance between inputs to and outputs from the dissolved pool of the ocean. This imbalance is mainly caused by the dominant oxic sink of Ni to Mn oxide-rich sediments. Though the Ni isotope composition of Fe-Mn crusts has previously been used as proxy for the Ni isotope composition of these sediments, crusts and nodules represent a very small part of the total Mn oxide output. Instead, Mn oxide microparticle supply to pelagic and hemi-pelagic sediments dominates the removal of Mn to sediments, but there are very few isotope data for such samples. Here we present the first extensive Ni concentration and isotope dataset from fully oxic Mn-rich pelagic sediments, from 6 different sites across the open Pacific and 10 closely-spaced sites in the Indian Ocean. We also present data for one hemi-pelagic site representing a suboxic setting on the California Margin. Abyssal Pacific and Indian Ocean sediments have a Ni/Mn ratio of 0.02 (similar to Fe-Mn crusts) and their authigenic Ni is isotopically lighter (δ60Ni = +0.26 to +1.08‰) than seawater (+1.33‰) and crusts (+1.55±0.38‰). Data presented here for organic carbon-rich suboxic sediments of the Californian margin have lower Ni/Mn ratios (0.004 to 0.014 for the oxic top of the core, where Mn oxide is present in abundance) and even lighter authigenic Ni isotope compositions (δ60Ni = -0.08±0.11‰). We show that the Ni isotopes of nearly all Mn-rich sediments and deposits analysed to date, including the new data presented here, are correlated with Co/Mn ratios, suggesting that both are controlled by accumulation rate, progressive incorporation of Ni into the metal oxide structure and isotopic re-equilibration between the solid and aqueous phase. At sites where sediments are diagenetically processed, such as the California Margin, differential diagenetic remobilisation of Mn, Ni and Co cause deviations from this correlation. We present a new mass balance calculation that recognises the importance of scavenging of oceanic Ni to Mn oxide-rich proximal hydrothermal sediments, with low Ni/Mn and light isotope compositions. The mass balance produces a budget that can be simultaneously balanced for both amounts and isotope compositions of Ni. This result provides a strong basis for the application of Ni isotopes as records of the evolution of the metal sink from the oxic oceans through Earth history.},
